We recommend that you create forks on Github so that we can review and consider those changes in the main project. This is
especially true for vendor packages -- we need more token-based payment gateway connectors.

Use the Issues not only for filing problems, but for recommendations as well. We value recommendations. However, we will reject
recommendations if it violates these principles core to this community project:

* Adds a framework dependency instead of raw PHP.
* Makes this harder to install.
* Makes the code far less readable.
* Adds unncessary busy work like Interface files.
* Makes it harder to extend the code.
* Deviates and supports more than charges and refunds.
* Deviates and supports something other than a token-based payment gateway.

We hope that our BSD license choice is suitable to you. Please let us know if not. In general, we absolutely want to encourage 
commercial use of this project but do want to recognize on copyright its contributors without liability.
